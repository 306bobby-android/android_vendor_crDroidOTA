crDroid 10.6
_Kernel 4.9, retrofit dynamic partitions, release-keys signed_

Changes since v10.5r2 (02 July) release:
- Yes we updated the signing keys again (forgot to add NFC to signed packages in the first round), so OTA verification will fail and you'll need to manually flash from recovery with adb sideload. Sorry, shouldn't happen again.
- June & July 2024 Android Security Bulletins including 14.0 QPR3 (android-14.0.0_r50 & android-14.0.0_r53) merged from upstream AOSP & LineageOS.
- Changes from upstream LineageOS:
  - Pffffft everything. It was the quarterly code rebase with huge changes from AOSP. Everyone hates this.
  - New Lights AIDL for enchilada to align with necessary QPR3 changes. Unfortunately, global changes to notification AIDL-related code in framework means that right now, notification LED is mostly broken for ALL devices equipped with one (not just enchilada). Guess we wait for the big brains at LOS for a fix (unless you're good at Android frameworks and java, in which case hmu).
  - Updated sensitive numbers & APNs for many regions/carriers (and new xml validation schema to keep changes from killing telephony in the future).
  - A million things we depend on to make things work right. They're heroes up there.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Updated translations.
  - Updated customizations/features to whatever is actually still working after the QPR3 merge. Sorry if your favorite feature didn't make the cut.
  - Now compiling kernel with clang 19.
  - Fixed a bunch of problems introduced by AOSP with QPR3 merge. So a whole lot of work to stay in the same place. "Thanks, Google!" :P
  - Sure looks like there are a lot of updates to things & bugfixes in there. I dunno what all, but they're in there!
  - Unfortunately, we aren't able to keep the ability to choose between multiple filesystem formats for userdata in recovery any longer. Any new factory resets will cause userdata to be formatted as ext4 for OnePlus 6 & 6T. Users who formatted with f2fs should still be able to keep it that way without any problems until the next factory reset, since the device-specific fstab entries are there for both possible filesystems on this device.
- Device-specific things I can't stop screwing around with:
  - DeviceAsWebcam! Using 0xCAFEBABE's commit stack from sdm710 & mithorium to bring up DeviceAsWebcam support now that there's a public implementation available in AOSP. Seems to work well! To use it, plug into a computer then choose "Webcam" instead of "File Transfer" or any of the other USB options. Rotating the device the first time may cause weird aspect ratio artifacts. Rotate it back, and back again, and it should make things better.
  - Updated media_codecs to drop outdated OMX software codecs and use c2 instead (avoids some of the issues other devices have been having since QPR3 merge).
  - Actually had a couple final updates from bananafunction to their kernel base! Thank you for all that hard work, friend!
  - Added proximity sensor checks to DT2W (and screen-off UDFPS for fajita) to help avoid some accidental screen-on-in-pocket with crDroid's pocket mode implementation.
  - Fixed USB OTG support again to keep working in Android 14.0 (had to modify fstab, and then drop the out-of-tree sdfat kernel driver since it doesn't seem to play nicely with storage manager any longer). You can install zips from USB OTG in recovery again from both FAT32 and exFAT formatted drives, yay.
  - Increased zram limit to 50% of system RAM again & fiddled with device_config to make sure things wouldn't get killed instantly in the background as quickly (Android looooves being able to page things out it seems).
  - Updated power/performance tuning related to wifi a bit. Should help if you were having problems with network streamed playback stuttering previously when screen was off.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Release Notes:
- Again, trying to download the OTA update will give you a "verification failed" error. You need to download to computer or USB OTG drive and install from recovery, due to an update in signing keys. I hope it won't be required after this, but the devs need to update things sometimes.
- TL;DR make sure you do the following setup steps or don't bother submitting bug reports:
  - Settings > Display > turn OFF "Prevent accidental wake-up" (use the Pocket Mode in crDroid Settings > Misc instead).
  - Settings > System > Gestures > turn OFF "Lift to check phone" (use crDroid Settings > User Interface > Ambient Display settings instead).
  - Settings > Apps > Default Apps > tap the Gear (settings) icon next to crDroid Home (the default launcher) to open "Home settings" > Recents > turn OFF the "Shake phone to clear all tasks" toggle switch (it causes terrible SystemUI slowdowns & crashes after a couple hours).
  - Go to https://gitlab.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_oneplus_apps/-/tree/14.0/sdm845/vendor/priv-app?ref_type=heads and download the APKs for OnePlusCamera and OnePlusGallery, then install them (it will ask you if you want to update the existing apps; choose yes each time).
  - [Optional] Go get this thing https://mega.nz/file/UHpDQS4L#FGKPas4_OM2Z5b5iE1R0zNZKUEa069uPJ7NAiluViXI and put it into Internal Storage > Android > obb > com.oneplus.gallery since it doesn't download correctly in-app due to sepolicy things I can't be bothered with in Android 14 (or don't if you don't care about OP Gallery being able to do image classification).

Known issues:
- Notification LED is broken for enchilada (and every other LineageOS-based device with a notification LED) currently. It works when you're selecting a color/pulse pattern, but doesn't work when you have app notifications/missed calls/new voicemail/new messages. Waiting for the big brains to figure out a fix.
- Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS).
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - Background blurring requires significant boosts to render smoothly. You should consider turning off the "window-level blurs" toggle in Settings > Display if you want to make things smoother & save battery. Or turn up AdrenoBoost in Settings > DeviceExtras for MOAR SMOOTH.
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PASS FOR GOOGLE PAY/WALLET EVENTUALLY. Google has been on a rampage against custom ROMs and unlocked bootloaders being able to spoof Play Integrity in a meaningful way, and seems to be requiring hardware-backed integrity (which is currently not spoofable) for Pay/Wallet. It has always been a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time. Currently a new install will show up with "Device Certified" in Play Store, but that might change any time and is not considered a bug. The ROM devs update the spoofed fingerprint, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile.
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - Go do the setup things in the Release Notes section; really. Or else I will ignore your bug reports. So there.
