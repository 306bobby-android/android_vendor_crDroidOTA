crDroid 10.7
_Kernel 4.9, retrofit dynamic partitions, release-keys signed_

Changes since v10.6 (31 July) release:
- August 2024 Android Security Bulletins (android-14.0.0_r55) merged from upstream AOSP & LineageOS.
- Changes from upstream LineageOS:
  - Everything I'm sure. I have no idea what all, but they're always hard at work doing amazing stuff that benefits everyone.
  - Updated AIDL-type lights HAL for Enchilada that actually works for notification LED again, woo! Turn the feature off & back on and change one of the settings at least once, probably.
  - Updated device-specific tree & kernel sources as of, I dunno, mid/late August. OMX media playback changes, switch to QTI memtrack AIDL HAL, patch poweroffalarm.apk extract time so power off alarm (most pointless feature ever; plug your phone in overnight and use charging control to limit charging percentage) should be more reliable, etc.
  - Fixed VPN data leak issue.
- Upstream changes from crDroid ROM sources:
  - Updated translations.
  - Updated PixelPropsUtils spoofing FP & implementation. Now correctly disables framework spoofing entirely (which probably then falls back to ih8sn props spoofing that I'm also building inline, but at least that's actually using this actual device's FPs even if it's an old print -- "It's an older code, sir, but it checks out").
  - New 3-finger-swipe gesture implementation (not just screenshots). You can add games/apps to GameSpace to disable 3-finger-swipe implementation on per-app basis.
  - Bugfixes for locked/hidden apps (requires authentication BEFORE switching to show the locked app from recents now, rather than showing off all your hentai "dating sim" game screen ;) ).
- Device-specific things I can't stop screwing around with:
  - Memory handling tuning, hopefully it remains "not going to kill things in the background immediately". Why I have to keep fussing with this I don't know.
  - Kernel compiled with clang 19.0.1 (new default "clang-latest" in crDroid, required one or two formatting commits to avoid new warning/error checks).
  - Wifi tuning (re-allowing "firmware roaming when device is idle", which was the default behavior before Android 14; seems to be failing to update AGPS location data frequently enough in 10.7).
  - Updated DeviceAsWebcam implementation.
  - Updated dummy QTI perfd implementation (patchset from LineageOS gerrit that wasn't merged as of mid-August last I checked that handles a few more function calls to make apps think they're working right).
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D
- I'm sure there's more. I'm a month behind and real life is too crazy. It's already out of date, but I'm pushing it anyway. It's better than it was. It'll get better than it is now, until it gets worse!

Release Notes:
- If you get a "verification failed" error when trying to OTA update, it means you're coming from an older version that was using test-keys or older signing keys. You need to update from recovery in that case (does not require wiping data; does require a computer & working USB cable & platform-tools).
- TL;DR make sure you do the following setup steps or don't bother submitting bug reports:
  - Settings > Display > turn OFF "Prevent accidental wake-up" (use the Pocket Mode in crDroid Settings > Misc instead).
  - Settings > System > Gestures > turn OFF "Lift to check phone" (use crDroid Settings > User Interface > Ambient Display settings instead).
  - Settings > Apps > Default Apps > tap the Gear (settings) icon next to crDroid Home (the default launcher) to open "Home settings" > Recents > turn OFF the "Shake phone to clear all tasks" toggle switch (it causes terrible SystemUI slowdowns & crashes after a couple hours).
  - Go to https://gitlab.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_oneplus_apps/-/tree/14.0/sdm845/vendor/priv-app?ref_type=heads and download the APKs for OnePlusCamera and OnePlusGallery, then install them (it will ask you if you want to update the existing apps; choose yes each time).
  - [Optional] Go get this thing https://mega.nz/file/UHpDQS4L#FGKPas4_OM2Z5b5iE1R0zNZKUEa069uPJ7NAiluViXI and put it into Internal Storage > Android > obb > com.oneplus.gallery since it doesn't download correctly in-app due to sepolicy things I can't be bothered with in Android 14 (or don't if you don't care about OP Gallery being able to do image classification).
- To use "Device As Webcam" feature, connect USB to a computer, and in the USB mode notification, instead of "charging this device" or "File Transfer/Android Auto", choose the new "Webcam" option from the list. Ta da!

Known issues:
_Look, none of this is really deal-breaking for most people. Things work well as a daily driver, all major systems work as they should as far as I can tell (or at least as well as in upstream LineageOS), battery life tends to be average-to-great depending on usage, etc._
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - SAFETYNET/PLAY INTEGRITY MAY NOT PASS. It's a cat & mouse game, and they can change the rules on their end at any time, and have been doing so frequently. This is not considered a bug. The ROM devs try this or that strategy, and it takes me forever to get updates releases pushed, and then it's out of date by the time you get it. Sorry. Hate Google, not me. Change to a better bank & use the website instead of a crappy "app", and complain loudly while you threaten to take your money somewhere else that doesn't make broken apps requiring Google's spyware in order to function.
  - As of Android 13, we're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it.
  - The "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option does not get enabled for use until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile & use it.
  - Wallpapers & Styles can cause a SystemUI crash if you swap clock faces & colors too rapidly, too many times before settling on something. It's a stupid/funny reason, I hope devs can figure out what to DO about it. (not sure if this is still true?)
  - Using "Hold handle to search" feature in Gesture Navigation settings is basically broken.
  - If you use Google One/Google Drive for automatic system backups, then Seedvault is gonna complain at you after every reboot about not being able to run a backup. Connect USB to computer & open a terminal (or install a terminal emulator like termux from f-droid) and run the following command: `pm disable-user --user 0 com.stevesoltys.seedvault` to disable Seedvault, since apparently it doesn't know when it's not wanted.
  - Some apps/games cannot connect to their IPv4 servers on mobile data with an IPv6-only carrier SIM (many games on MetroPCS in the US, BGMI and others on Reliance/JIO in India, etc). This seems to be common to LineageOS-based custom ROMs on this device. OxygenOS used Google's carrier info/config stack and still works nearly 3 years later, and current Pixel-based ROMs that use Google's carrier config stack seem to work fine. I have no idea how to fix this, definitely above my pay grade.
  - Lockscreen layout for Face Unlock instructions is overlapped by UDFPS circle in crDroid 10.7. Hopefully has been fixed in more recent ROM sources since issue was reported, but let's get one month's update out at a time, yeah?
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - Go do the setup things in the Release Notes section; really. Or else I will ignore your bug reports. So there.
  - Some USB gamepads seem to no longer work? Dunno if this is due to USB Gadget implementation for DeviceAsWebcam support or what. One user reported that their Backbone USB-C no longer works in 10.7, but I can't really tell what's up from the logs. My 8BitDo gamepads still work fine while directly attached via USB-C and connecting via Bluetooth, so I know it's not just broken globally. Might have to set/change USB privacy mode in "Trust" or set a different default USB mode in Developer Options or just unplug & reconnect a few times?
  - One person seems to have doubled-up icons on lock screen. Can't reproduce, but might be a combination of settings with different icon packs or fonts or lockscreen styles. Try clearing your Settings or crDroid Settings app storage, reboot, and re-set preferences if you face this issue.
  - For some people, the "update app with same version of app but installed as user" approach to fixing OnePlus Camera doesn't work and it STILL has black screen on app launch & crashes shortly thereafter. I don't know why, and don't have time to fix. It's an ugly hack in the first place, and I don't have time to make it better right now.
