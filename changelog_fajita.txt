crDroid 9.1

Changelog since v9.0-December release:
- January 2023 Android Security Bulletin merged from upstream.
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS (updated kernel now supports compressed apexes, should have a little more free space in system partition now).
- Kernel rebased on top of LineageOS (which itself was rebased on top of the LineageOS/android_kernel_qcom_sdm845 kernel base). Then re-applied updates like 4.9.337 LTS merges & CLO tag LA.UM.10.3.r1-01700 (thanks to BananaFunction), re-imported newer wifi drivers since they seem to perform better (faster reconnects to known 5GHz networks after restart or coming back into range, better link speed) & applied updated commit stacks for those, and finally my stack of modifications for crDroid (mostly pulled from MCD kernel, thanks to Danny).
- Now using modified charging info flag; fixes charging status info on AOD screen, and when DASH charging (so SmartCharging feature stops much closer to target percentage).
- Custom font support in material apps working again (including keyboard), woo! Some apps (Gboard anyway, if installed as user app) still need to have custom font reapplied after reboot.
- Lots of updates to Parallel Spaces functionality: now you can enable Google Apps for spaces only (and disable on main profile -- careful with this!).
- Lockscreen action buttons (lower left & right) are back! See Settings > crDroid Settings > Lock Screen to change button target actions. Note: QR code scanner uses the built-in Lineage "Aperture" camera. If you like this feature, stop "debloating" the camera apps, ffs.
- More art & bionic optimizations in crDroid source (OPCamera still works, yay).
- Statusbar spacing & burn-in protection behavior corrected finally; stays where it should be, so now I can put it back out toward the edges where it was.
- Fixed "edge long-swipe gesture" actions, woo!
- Fixes for a few more "themed icons" getting found & applied, updated Lawnicons import.
- Fixed "widget that should be 1 grid row high will only resize down to 2 rows high, after I've increased the vertical number of grid rows to 5x6 or 5x7 from 5x5 to fit more things on my screen" problem in Launcher, yaaaasssss (this has annoyed me FOREVER). :partying_face:
  - And a big :middle_finger: to Google for treating our phones with > 6-inch screens like preschool toys instead of pocket computers any time we try to fit more useful information on the display at once.
- Got some other changes merged in crDroid project, including fixing "back gesture is actually logically prevented from working at all on lowest sensitivity setting", and adding ability to tweak thickness of navigation pill.
- Fix for bluetooth audio disconnecting on some chipsets that do encrypted handshake but then drop back to unencrypted for streaming since they don't do a2dp offloading.
- Re-enabled hfp inband ringing; now your bluetooth headphones/speaker will play your custom ringtone instead of their built-in generic jingle when there's an incoming call.
- Upstream fixes to PixelProps for SafetyNet attestation, updated translations, bionic optimizations, more framework bug fixes, probably some other things fixed as well.

Known issues:
- People don't read documentation.
- You tell me, with logs!

Installation notes:
- In case of bootloop (boot animation stuck for longer than about 2 minutes and never gets to lock screen), reboot to recovery and manually flash the ROM zip either via ADB sideload from computer, or from a FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive via OTG, then reboot to recovery again, and re-flash your same Google Apps/microG/Magisk/whatever install zips (again via ADB sideload or USB OTG), and reboot system. This *should* take care of any lingering errors with old things getting stuck in your /system/addon.d/ directory that might be trying to preserve old privileged system apps without privileged permissions (which is what causes those boot loops in the first place).
- The built-in OTA updater in Settings > System > Updater goes a lot faster if you go into Updater preferences and toggle on "prioritize updater process", and make sure the screen stays on by using the Caffeine QS tile, or "never sleep while charging" toggle in Developer Options, or changing your Display timeout to 30 minutes.
- See XDA thread for other troubleshooting other common installation issues including problems with OxygenOS Camera & Gallery.
