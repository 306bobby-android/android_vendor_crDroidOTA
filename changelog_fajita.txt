crDroid 8.15

Changelog since v8.14 release:
- Merged up through July 2023 Android Security Bulletins from upstream.
- Whatever the ROM dev team changed upstream in LineageOS and crDroid sources (not much? they're busy with Android 13+).
- Should have fixed pocket detection/BlackScreenOS again, finally, I hope (basically one overlay tweak for device trees, and one tweak in canceling a state in the fingerprint HAL in hardware/oneplus/).
- No other device tree/kernel/vendor blob changes.

Build type: Monthly (-ish)
Device: OnePlus 6T (fajita)
Device maintainer: Jordan Whiteley (Terminator_J)
