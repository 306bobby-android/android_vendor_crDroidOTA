crDroid 8.12

Changelog since v8.11 release:
- Merged November ASB & changes from upstream LineageOS device/kernel/vendor trees.
- Whatever the ROM dev teams changed upstream in LineageOS and crDroid sources (not much? they're busy with Android 13).
- Other misc fixes ... probably.

Known issues:
- The usual LineageOS Android 12 things.
- (fajita-only) The "Pocket detection" toggle in crDroid Settings > Miscellaneous will interfere with "Screen off UDFPS" (crDroid Settings > Lock screen > UDFPS customization) and "Prevent accidental wakeup" (Display settings). If you use it, turn off the others, or you might run into the screen-won't-turn-on issue. Personally, I was just dealing with having to press the power button a few extra times, because disabling "Pocket detection" ended up with me almost calling emergency services several times a day.
Thankfully this seems to be fixed in crDroid 9 (Android 13), so I definitely recommend upgrading if that's a problem for you.

Installation notes:
- In case of bootloop (boot animation stuck for longer than about 2 minutes and never gets to lock screen), reboot to recovery and manually flash the ROM zip either via ADB sideload from computer, or from a FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive via OTG, then reboot to recovery again, and re-flash your same Google Apps/microG/Magisk/whatever
install zips (again via ADB sideload or USB OTG), and reboot system. This *should* take care of any lingering errors with old things getting stuck in your /system/addon.d/ directory that might be trying to preserve old privileged system apps without privileged permissions (which is what causes those boot loops in the first place).
- The built-in OTA updater in Settings > System > Updater goes a lot faster if you go into Updater preferences and toggle on "prioritize updater process", and make sure the screen stays on by using the Caffeine QS tile, or "never sleep while charging" toggle in Developer Options, or changing your Display timeout to 30 minutes.
- See XDA thread for other troubleshooting other common installation issues including problems with OxygenOS Camera & Gallery.
