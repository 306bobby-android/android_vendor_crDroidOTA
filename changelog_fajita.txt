crDroid 9.6

Changelog since v9.5r2 (20 June) release:
- June 2023 Android Security Bulletin merged.
- QPR3 merged from AOSP -- your favorite feature is probably missing or works differently or moved again. Sorry. Please cope gracefully.
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
  - Lineage [Battery] Health now included; Smart/adaptive battery charging is now in Settings > Battery and is a much better implementation that seems to support battery-idle mode correctly with our kernel. Sweet!
  - Single-touch wake & unlock: Due to upstream changes, you may now have to make sure to go into Settings > Security > Face & Fingerprint Unlock > Fingerprints and enable the toggle for one-touch screen wake & unlock in order for real FP sensor (enchilada) for wake & unlock with a single touch to keep working. The equipvalent screen-off UDFPS (fajita) feature might require you to toggle the setting off & back on a couple times in Settings > crDroid Settings > Lock Screen > UDFPS Customization before it works again.
- crDroid:
  - Neobuddy found/fixed a memory leak with QS shade that was causing a lot of the reported stutters/lags. SystemUI should stop being so crashy after a few days, and hopefully people will stop complaining about pulling down the shade being not so smooth. Honestly, I never really had the problem with NikGapps on the tester enchilada or an old install of MindTheGapps on my daily driver fajita.
  - Sorry that your favorite feature is missing. I'll promise to look very concerned about it as I just spend the next few months merging security updates without really changing anything because I'm busy af in real life.
- Device-specific:
  - Re-updated kernel commits from bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch, I dunno, everything seems fine. Reintroduced the squashed "revert some OnePlus Camera driver-specific changes" commit because it was getting crashdumpy again, but honestly, it's happening on vanilla LineageOS as well, so I'm done worrying about it. I'm sorry it happens, definitely above my pay grade; your most stable bet is going to be a v7.3 or v7.4 based GCam mod like DMGC or Urnyx05, which are old.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Other notes / Known issues:
- Recommended GApps is my "elite build" NikGapps config. Download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikgapps/files/Elite-Releases/crDroid-op6/NikGapps-T/
- Look, practically EVERY SINGLE ISSUE anyone has had lately (massive battery drains or weird slowdowns/jank or things FCing or bootloops) are caused by problems with installation/updating or bad downloads or bad USB cables and gets resolved by flashing with a good cable from the built-in recovery. Reboot to recovery, adb sideload the current ROM zip, Advanced > reboot recovery (so the slots switch), adb sideload the latest release of your preferred Google Apps/microG/Magisk zip, reboot system, and leave the thing plugged in overnight and your problems will almost assuredly be over.

*Failing to reboot to recovery after the ROM installer zip has completed, means it won't switch slots, and you won't have any GApps installed into the new system partition, and everything will be terrible.*
