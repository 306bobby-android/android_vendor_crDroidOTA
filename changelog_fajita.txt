crDroid 9.3

Changelog since v9.2 hotfix 1 (01 April) release:
- 9.3 includes the Android 13 "QPR2" merge. It was huge and took forever and this is how AOSP does things now. Every three months, woo! A lot of time & effort at every level went into making this feel like a small incremental update rather than the major rewrite it was.
- March 2023 ASB merged.
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
- Hidden/protected apps settings now actually stick after reboot even for user apps.
- Unlinked ringtone & notification volumes are now implemented in a different fashion by AOSP directly, which requires a compile-time config flag, rather than a secure setting runtime toggle like how LineageOS' implementation used to use. So it's hard-coded on now (or off, but I turned it on for these builds). I did my best to re-add the volume panel dialog slider for notification volume, but as before, it's only actually visible when the notification AudioManager stream is active, and shortly thereafter.
- aptX and aptX-HD blobs dropped from proprietary files; now using Qualcomm's officially-available encoder implementation. Tested working, in case you were worried.
- Updated kernel commits from bananafunction's stable lineage-20 branch. Re-applied a couple Qualcomm/CLO bugfixes/updates that were overzealously reverted as part of the "see if camera will crash less" set from 9.2 hotfix 1.
- Tuning some memory (and i/o readahead) values to make it a little less kill-background-process happy. And by "some values" I mean literally switched from deprecated lmk kernel driver to using Android LMKD with values from crosshatch (also sdm845 with similar RAM); seems slightly less kill-happy, battery life still good. Sweet.
- Updated burn-in protection code. Fixed statusbar spacing on keyguard to align with unlocked view, and make it so statusbar items won't go under notch anymore on enchilada (and fix corresponding value on fajita just in case). It's perfect now; keep your fabricated screenshots purporting to show things getting cut off to yourself because I won't believe you. Also, I can't stop you from adding things to the left side or making your clock ungodly long, and causing even 2 notification icons to go under the notch. That's not a bug, that's just you doing silly things with our extended customization. Android won't switch to the overflow dot until after there are more than 4 notification icons present. Works As Intended(tm).
- Tune WiFi to prefer sticking to currently-selected network a little more strongly again, and to be less inclined to roam from 5GHz to 2.4GHz if already on a 5GHz network.
- "Misc tweaks and bugfixes".
