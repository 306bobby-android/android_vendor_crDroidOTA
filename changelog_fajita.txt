crDroid 9.5

Changelog since v9.4 (09 May) release:
- May 2023 ASB merged.
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
- crDroid:
  - Updated kernel clang version to 17.0.2.
  - Lots of stuff I imagine, I dunno. Haven't been paying attention because I'm always a month behind.
- Device-specific:
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction's lineage-20 branch & upstream LineageOS lineage-20 branch.
  - Much thanks to @snnbyyds for inspiration to dig into crosshatch (Pixel 3XL) trees, and whose work on OP6-series for PixelExperience also helped me figure out a few other things.
  - Added ZRAM writeback for uncompressible pages & configured to mostly match crosshatch (Pixel 3XL, also sdm845).
  - Dropped ZRAM to 25% of system RAM (crosshatch only shipped with 8GB, but we have more hardware variants) & tuned a little more.
  - Some more composition tuning to make it smoove & reduce jank; should help a bit when pulling down shade or on lockscreen with active mediaplayer session visible.
  - Further block device I/O, cgroup & PSI virtual memory pressure tracking tuning.
  - I thought I managed to add back USB-OTG support in recovery, so you can load from a USB thumbdrive instead of ONLY ever being able to flash via ADB sideloading in Android 13, but now it's not working again? Dunno there, I'll keep working on it, maybe...
  - Reverted kernel commits that attempted to lock GPU thermal throttling off by making sysfs node write-once-then-read-only... they were actually locking throttling ON for the last few months, leading the governor to attempt to decrease GPU freqs once the phone got up to operating temperatures (30-40C). Instead, added control to DeviceExtras to allow controlling Adreno thermal throttling from there. If you want to prioritize CPU over GPU, turn it on. If you want to prioritize graphical smoothness, turn it off.
  - Dropped -O3 optimization flag in kernel Makefile back down to -02; should be less crash-dumpy about camera stuff now.
  - For the clang nerds in the back, enabled LLVM_IAS (clang inline assembler) in kernel finally. Whoops, that wasn't getting used automatically even with LLVM=1 enabled... guess we were using gnu binutils assembler before.
  - Also finished enabling VDSO compat and 32-bit VDSO compat cross-compile in kernel, might help speed up... something? That wasn't actually getting built before at any rate, now it is.
  - "Misc tweaks and bugfixes" (dropped another unused charging driver, "qnovo", that wasn't doing anything except making more things show up in sysfs that we don't care about; regular and DASH charging seem unaffected).
- Overall it seems _slightly_ more battery hungry if you're doing things that utilize kgsl (GPU acceleration) on a regular basis -- so turn off that QS shade background transparency, or turn on GPU throttling. Just feels technically a little smoother, a few more things done right, performance feels good overall.
- And if you come to the TG channel, I've got a little something something for you kernel-wise that isn't going into the official release build. :D

Please test:
- Is it more magical?
- Is it, in fact, less cra[shdum]ppy?
