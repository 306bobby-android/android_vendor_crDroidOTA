crDroid 9.5-r2

Changelog since v9.5 (03 June) release:
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
- Still May 2023 ASB, since the June security bulletin requires merging QPR3, which the ROM team is currently working hard at finishing.
- crDroid:
  - I managed to re-add independent Battery Styles for QS shade compared to statusbar (and battery estimate if you have "turbo", Google's DeviceHealthServices) installed. Enjoy it while it lasts; everything will be ruined again with the QPR3 merge here in a bit. :D
  - At least a couple things I'd imagine, I dunno. Haven't been paying attention because I'm always a month behind.
- Device-specific:
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction's lineage-20-test branch & upstream LineageOS lineage-20 branch.
  - Dropped ZRAM writeback (meh, less thrashing on the flash storage pls).
  - Dropped a few more of the overly-ambitious changes from 9.5 that didn't seem to actually do much, except make it a little more battery-hungry. I think battery life is back where we want it to be.
  - Re-added the "squash revert" commit in kernel to help with some of the camera usage causing drops to Qualcomm Crashdump mode. But honestly, it's going to keep being a thing with newer Google Camera ports. If you need stability for lots of photos, stick with a GCam port (like DMGC or Urnyx05) based on v7.3 or v7.4 for best results.
  - "Misc tweaks and bugfixes".
- If it feels like it's still slightly too battery hungry, turn on the "GPU Throttling" toggle in DeviceExtras to save a little bit more (may cause a little more jank in gaming).

Other notes:
- I updated my "elite build" NikGapps package, and 16 June or newer builds of crDroid-op6 now include a few extra packages in there that should help with some app compability going forward (added DeviceSetup, GooglePartnerSetup, DeviceHealthServices, and CarrierServices).

- And if you come to the TG channel, I've got a little something something for you kernel-wise that isn't going into the official release build. :D

- If you're experiencing DRASTIC battery draining, that usually indicates that there's a Google Apps permissions problem, and you should download updated MindTheGapps or NikGapps packages, reboot to recovery, dirty flash the ROM zip, reboot to recovery again, and dirty flash all the updated versions of your necessary Google Apps & addons zips, and then reboot back to system. It's not a ROM problem; I have vanilla users (folks who run without any Google Apps or microG) who get nearly 24h of screen-on time.

- If you're experiencing a boot loop, do the same thing. I've also had the built-in updater act REALLY weird on occasion. So please, please, read about how slot-switching works in the first post, and actually follow the instructions: If you run into problems with a boot loop, get into recovery (unplug USB, hold down power + volumeUp button until you get to bootloader, then enter recovery), adb sideload the ROM zip, Advanced > Reboot recovery, adb sideload the latest version of your Google Apps or microG package if using (and Magisk if using), THEN reboot to system.

*Failing to reboot to recovery after the ROM installer zip has completed, means it won't switch slots, and you won't have any GApps installed into the new system partition, and everything will be terrible.*

- If you get problems with Google Play Store or Android Setup complaining that you need to connect to wi-fi in order to download updates, go into Settings > Apps > "See all __ apps" > [overflow menu] "Show system", then for Android Setup, Google Play Services, and Google Play Store, get app info and make sure to toggle on Network Access for all of them (or turn it off & back on), clear app cache, and then reboot as quickly as possible after. That should get them to realize they CAN connect to the internet after all.
