Changes since official v6.22 release:
- October ASB (Android Security Bulletin) merged.
- Rebased device tree and kernel tree on lineage-17.1 base with carefully-curated improvements from lineage-18.1, rather than 18.1 with a million reverts (messssy, even if squashed).
- Decommonized & updated oneplus-fwk, which was basically only there to try and support OOSCam v3, and that didn't work, so oh well. Shipping with OOSCam V2, which works except for depth effect (no portrait mode still, sorry), so pretty much it's good for 60fps video and basic photos.
- Dropped built-in GCam (go ahead and use your favorite port still, but now there's more room in system partition for bigger GApps).
- Seriously, lots of cleanup under the hood; prepping for "frozen" device & kernel trees to shift to security-update-only maintenance releases. 

Known bugs:
??? It's old and most any issues are gonna be things involving framework, which won't get updated. But if you like photography, you might like this better than Android 11, because of GCam ports that like to apply postprocessing that won't work under R.
