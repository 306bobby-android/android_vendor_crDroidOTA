crDroid 8.8

Changelog since 8.7 release
- Merged August 2022 ASB from upstream.
- Moved OnePlusCamera & OnePlusGallery out of system partition into vendor/priv-apps/ to save space in system (should allow for bigger Google Apps packages if you insist on using something other than MindTheGapps) -- Should work fairly seamlessly coming from 8.7 official, but see installation notes below if you have trouble with OPCam or OPGallery after updating.
- Enabled support for exFAT-formatted USB OTG drives (depends on kernel support, in case you flash a custom kernel). Technically it should allow ANY vold-supported filesystems to work, with functional kernel support, but I've only tested exFAT (works), and NTFS (doesn't work).
- New QuickSettings tile customization options from your friendly neighborhood crDroid dev team!
- Enchilada: Something about fingerprint blobs from upstream in Lineage. It'll probably ask you to re-enroll fingerprints.
- Enchilada: At some point I guess battery estimate got fixed, and I didn't notice because some overlay in MinMicroG seems to override it back to not working. Sucks to be me.
- Adjust AOD a little bit, should hopefully wake up more reliably, AND be a little brighter by default (so you can, y'know, read it).
- Fajita: UDFPS should suck a lot less. This was probably my fault for a couple releases there; sorry.
- Dropped SmartPixels because it's ugly af and buggy; use framework dimming ("Extra Dim") if you want the screen so dim that you can't read anything.

Known issues:
- Basically just everything that's still funky in upstream LineageOS:
-- No audio passed to remote display when casting via wifi display/miracast (will get fixed soon, but didn't make the cut for this month).
-- There's ugly blank space at the top of the screen after rebooting before first unlock. After first unlock it's fine.
-- Up-arrow screen-off gesture doesn't work (something else is eating that keycode); all the rest work with the caveat that single side swipes don't work unless they're BOTH assigned to an action.
-- The NFC stack will crash if something tries to *read* data from the phone. So NFC payments via Google Wallet/Pay/whatever-it-is-this-week should work, but Android Beam/Nearby Sharing will fail and might require a reboot to enable NFC again.
- Maintainer is busy af in real life and takes forever to get releases out.

Installation notes:
- I've had some people end up having privileged permissions not getting copied when using the built-in updater, which results in a bootloop at boot animation. I can't fix it for you, but if this happens to you, DON'T PANIC. You should be able to get an "adb logcat" during the bootloop on your computer with USB cable connected, and search the output for "fatal" to figure out which package is having the fatal error about missing privileged permissions. Then you can get a root shell in built-in recovery and mount system as read-write, or fastboot boot SIDDK's latest TWRP 3.6.2_12-2 or newer TWRP boot img files if you'd rather do it that way, and manually remove the offending Google app package that's missing its permissions. Check <mountpoint>/system/addon.d/ to find out if there's a rogue OTA survival script copying things over that doesn't belong there (this might have been a bug from earlier versions of Nik Gapps). You may find that just removing everything in system/addon.d/ and then reboot to recovery & manually re-flash the MindTheGapps & Magisk installers (assuming that's what you're using) before rebooting back to system and running the update will help make sure you only have what you should have in there.
- If you experience issues with OnePlusCamera & OnePlusGallery after updating, first get App Info and clear storage & cache for both. You might have luck with "update" installing the same apk version in-place (it will ask if you want to update the app, even though it's the same version). I used OP Camera v3.14.40, which is available from here: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oneplus-ltd/oneplus-camera/oneplus-camera-3-14-40-release/oneplus-camera-3-14-40-android-apk-download/ and OP Gallery v4.0.297, available from here: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oneplus-ltd/oneplus-gallery/oneplus-gallery-4-0-297-release/oneplus-gallery-4-0-297-2-android-apk-download/
