crDroid 7.14 - January 2022 ASB release notes/changelog:
Changelog since cr7.13 official release - December 2021 ASB:

Common:
- Merged January 2022 Android Security Bulletin from upstream.
- Whatever the devs changed upstream (not much? they're busy with cr8 — looks like new wifi & signal styles in crDroid Settings, but they only work if you leave defaults in Styles & Wallpaper, due to competing overlays)
- Went back to previous implementation of custom init for overriding props, that right now only sets dalvik vm properties based on system RAM size (since there are multiple hardware variants) — should fix issues with installing in TWRP or LOS recovery complaining about the wrong device.
- If you're installing from recovery for some reason and getting errors about the device not matching like "update is for X, was expecting Y", then please reboot to bootloader and fastboot flash the recovery-boot-eng.img to boot_a and boot_b, reboot bootloader, then reboot back into recovery (or fastboot boot your TWRP img since we just nuked it) and try applying the update again. Remember that stock recovery does not process addon.d OTA survival scripts, so you'll need to reboot recovery AGAIN after sideloading the ROM zip, and then sideload Magisk/microG/GApps/whatever installer zips. There's a good reason I'm pushing the use of the built-in Updater (even in Local Install mode for manually flashing a zip) in Settings > System > Updater; it Just Works(tm) and correctly executes addon.d survival scripts afterward (tested successfully with Magisk v23 & v24 canary builds, NikGapps core, basic, and omni, MindTheGapps, and MinMicroG forced-system installs, also reports that OpenGapps works fine as well).

Enchilada-specific:
- Nothing new specifically. But you were already perfect, weren't you? <3

Known issues:
Common:
- To reiterate: you need to have Magisk installed to use the built-in updater in Settings > System > Updater, otherwise it'll just error out. This is a bug, and it's not something I can fix. Recommend you use the Caffeine QS tile set to "infinite" so that the screen doesn't go off while updating, because otherwise the CPU will clock down to save power and it'll take FOREVERRRRRR. You can always uninstall Magisk Manager, then re-flash the stock boot.img to restore the un-patched ramdisk (attached below) afterward if you don't want to leave it installed.
- Google Hotword recognition is kinda broken right now (on more than one custom ROM/device, not just us), and will cause some screw-up that prevents microphone audio from being allowed to go anywhere else if it's enabled.
- No, really; you need firmware from OxygenOS 11.1.2.2. If you're updating from official v7.11 release or older and are stuck at "Android is starting..." looping endlessly, then press & hold power, reboot to bootloader, and follow the instructions for updating firmware to OxygenOS 11.1.2.2 from the first post. It doesn't wipe data, you shouldn't lose anything.
- The "up vee" /\ screen-off gesture, left-to-right single finger swipe, and right-to-left single finger swipe screen-off gestures might not work, all the other ones do. I *do* finally know why, I'll try to fix it in cr7.15; but it might end up having screen-off gestures visible in two places. Sorry.
- You tell me! With logs!

Other stuff:
- Sorry OOSCam v2 kinda sucks, but it takes ugly selinux haxx to make OOSCam v3 work correctly and I'm not looking to try and bypass security to make it work. If you want to try running permissive (requires root) & manually installing an update to OnePlus Camera v3.x to see if it works, feel free. Or just stay on official 7.11 release.
- Our prebuilt vendor sucks, there aren't any functional, commonized, lineage-compatible source-built vendor bringups that are properly implemented for both fajita & enchilada at the same time for either Android 11 or 12 that I can just drop in, and I've spent months & months of time I don't really have trying to do it myself to no avail.
- I'm sorry that updates have been coming a month late, and never seem to resolve long-standing issues. I just don't have the spoons to get stuff out the door any sooner. I know cr7.15 finally dropped, I'll update and start test builds of that here soon, but y'all deserve better than for me to just sit on updates that have essentially been done for weeks & weeks because I didn't want to do all the busy work of writing changelogs & updating XDA posts & making proper OTA git commits.
- I need a nap.
