crDroid 9.11

Changelog since v9.10 (03 November) release:
- November 2023 Android Security Bulletin (android-13.0.0_r75) merged from AOSP.
- Upstream changes to ROM sources from LineageOS & crDroid merged.
- crDroid:
  - I dunno, stuff. Built-in Dialer should be less likely to crash in previously-problematic scenarios, especially when certain bluetooth devices are connected.
  - Updated PixelPropUtils, repeatedly over the last couple weeks. Play Integrity (SN) should be passing again (until Google changes things on their end YET AGAIN -- it's always going to be a cat & mouse game).
  - If you noticed that the "use pure black" toggle under "Settings > Display > Dark THeme" submenu was missing, well, it's back.
- Any device-specific device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
  - More little stuff, Edwin's finally been getting some of his modifications merged, yay! Some audio-related property updates (sync with OxygenOS a little where useful).
- Device-specific:
  - More cleanup; prepping for Android 14 benefits everyone!
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction.
  - RIP OOS-style display panel handling. LineageOS kernel commits for panel modes still bother me, deeply, personally, but... it seems like DC Dimmin- *cough* "Anti Flicker" no longer causes micro-fades on enchilada when screen brightness is turned down, so we'll just go with it. Fixes issues with sRGB gamut not being maintained when transitioning from fullscreen HDR content to other apps or turning panel off & back on again quickly. Perhaps the real treasure was the friendships we made along the way.
  - Didn't get around to importing libperfmgr & lmkd yet again; not sure if I'm going to bother with it in 9.x or save that for crDroid 10.x/Android 14, or just "never"... since things seem to be doing so well now. But it's on the to-do list to at least try.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Known issues:
- The AOSP bluetooth stack in A13+ doesn't like the car stereo in one guy's Renault and audio stutters _just in voice call mode_ (BT SCO; media audio is fine). Same issue with official LineageOS, bug report is opened but no traction on it, sadly. If you drive a Renault, consider upgrading.
- The entire release cycle of Android 13, the built-in Dialer app actually can't just pop on top with the fullscreen "incoming call" interface. Works fine when the screen is *off*, but if you want to actually see something over top of everything else when someone calls you and the phone is already awake, you need to enable Heads-Up Notifications (and I recommend using the "less boring notifications" toggle in crDroid Settings, unless you actually WANT all the spam from spywar- *cough* social media apps blocking your view constantly, you sick puppy). I've raised the issue multiple times with the ROM dev team, dunno what to do at this point.
- For some reason the "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option is greyed-out until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile; then it becomes available & works. ROM devs know, low-priority issue I guess.
- The extra "Lock Screen" security options are missing due to an overlay in NikGapps which combines Security & Privacy settings fragments into a new layout, which clobbers our ROM layout. I'm working with Nikhail to figure it out, so in the mean time you can either use the current MindTheGapps arm64 13.0 release (if you feel like clean installing or resetting runtime permissions), or manually search Settings for "Quick Unlock" to find that screen.
