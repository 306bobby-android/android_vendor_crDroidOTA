crDroid 8.10

Changelog since 8.9 release
- Merged October ASB & changes from upstream LineageOS device/kernel/vendor trees.
- Removed most of the device tree init script changes & kernel scheduler changes that I had just picked as a monolithic chunk from the gerrit, back to using regular QTI kernel lmk for now (same as LineageOS).
- Dropped a bit of wifi & charger stuff from kernel commits to simplify things.
- Switched to zstd algorithm for zram, set to use 50% system RAM (this is what the stock OOS boot scripts try to do already, they just haven't been able to under LineageOS all this time, whoops).
- VoLTE/VoWiFi should be allowed by default now unless carrier explicitly disallows it.
- Google Dialer should now allow call recording.
- Little more performance tuning, should help jank while scrolling.
- Build & ship "ih8sn" inline (spoofs safetynet-sensitive props without having to install Magisk).
- Switched to sdFAT (updated exFAT) driver, kanged from LineageOS xiaomi-sdm845 kernel (for beryllium), cuz the OnePlus exFAT driver version is OLD.
- Moved DC Dimming ("Anti-Flicker") and High Brightness Mode ("Outdoor mode") control back to LineageOS "LiveDisplay" section of Display settings, to make my life easier.
- Since Automatic "Outdoor mode" HBM lux threshold can't currently be modified by user at runtime in LiveDisplay, changed the compile time threshold down to 7000 lux & hysteresis value to 1000 to match what the regular auto brightness controller is doing at that point. The default 12000 was ridiculously high, and resulted in HBM only coming on after it was too bright to read the screen even with HBM enabled. Might adjust it a touch higher later, but it's much more functional now already.
- The usual device sources cleanup in prep for Android 13 (not visible, but administrative overhead takes time & helps prevent bugs/problems later).

Known issues:
- The usual LineageOS Android 12 things.
- (fajita-only) The "Pocket detection" toggle in crDroid Settings > Miscellaneous will interfere with "Screen off UDFPS" (crDroid Settings > Lock screen > UDFPS customization) and "Prevent accidental wakeup" (Display settings). If you use it, turn off the others, or you might run into the screen-won't-turn-on issue. Personally, I was just dealing with having to press the power button a few extra times, because disabling "Pocket detection" ended up with me almost calling emergency services several times a day.
Thankfully this seems to be fixed in crDroid 9 (Android 13), so I definitely recommend upgrading once that's released.

Installation notes:
- In case of bootloop (boot animation stuck for longer than about 2 minutes and never gets to lock screen), reboot to recovery and manually flash the ROM zip either via ADB sideload from computer, or from a FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive via OTG, then reboot to recovery again, and re-flash your same Google Apps/microG/Magisk/whatever install zips (again via ADB sideload or USB OTG), and reboot system. This *should* take care of any lingering errors with old things getting stuck in your /system/addon.d/ directory that might be trying to preserve old privileged system apps without privileged permissions (which is what causes those boot loops in the first place).
- The built-in OTA updater in Settings > System > Updater goes a lot faster if you go into Updater preferences and toggle on "prioritize updater process", and make sure the screen stays on by using the Caffeine QS tile, or "never sleep while charging" toggle in Developer Options, or changing your Display timeout to 30 minutes.
- See XDA thread for other troubleshooting other common installation issues including problems with OxygenOS Camera & Gallery.

I'm pretty sure this programmatically-generated part of the changelog is no longer going to show things I've done with device-specific changes, since I switched to directly `git clone`ing my trees instead of allowing `repo` to ruin everything and prevent me from being able to manage my projects the way I want to manage them.
Sorry.
