crDroid 8.0

Changelog since 8.8 release
- Merged September 2022 ASB from upstream.
- Change kernel to use EdwinMoq's display mode handling commit from LineageOS gerrit (merges in OOS R-11 code in with UDFPS changes for Android 12), since my "OOS Color Modes" commit had some problems.
- Smart Charging is back! Check in Settings > crDroid Settings > Miscellaneous (uses input_suspend sysfs node; you should still use AccA if you want battery idle mode support using a dual-node setup with input_suspend and op_disable_charge).
- Audio routes correctly over WiFi Display now! Also, remote USB mouse/keyboard control of phone from destination (if they exist on display device).
- Talked to the crDroid dev team and got the prebuilt "70-velvet.sh" OTA survival script removed from our system/addon.d/ inclusions; should resolve some bootloop scenarios when updating.
- Neobuddy89 fixed the unkillable bluetooth statusbar icon.
- Re-added TWS support (missing in 8.7 & 8.8, whoops) for bluetooth earbuds.
- Importing some USB fixes backported from Google's 4.9 Android kernel sources as requested by @Sebastian.
- Fixes to clang/llvm compilation errors & warnings backported from lineage-20.
- Streamlining/tidying in preparation for Android 13.

Known issues:
- The usual LineageOS Android 12 things.
- HBM will now be turned off when the screen goes off. That's how the OnePlus OxygenOS display panel handling codebase works. AutoHBM in DeviceExtras will still turn it back on if you enable that feature & the ambient light level is bright enough (like direct sunlight). Not a bug.
- (fajita-only) The "Pocket detection" toggle in crDroid Settings > Miscellaneous will interfere with "Screen off UDFPS" (crDroid Settings > Lock screen > UDFPS customization) and "Prevent accidental wakeup" (Display settings). If you use it, turn off the others, or you might run into the screen-won't-turn-on issue. Personally, I would just disable the "Pocket detection" toggle on fajita.

Installation notes:
- In case of bootloop (boot animation stuck for longer than about 2 minutes and never gets to lock screen), reboot to recovery and manually flash the ROM zip either via ADB sideload from computer, or from a FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive via OTG, then reboot to recovery again, and re-flash your same Google Apps/microG/Magisk/whatever install zips (again via ADB sideload or USB OTG), and reboot system. This *should* take care of any lingering errors with old things getting stuck in your /system/addon.d/ directory that might be trying to preserve old privileged system apps without privileged permissions (which is what causes those boot loops in the first place).
- The built-in OTA updater in Settings > System > Updater goes a lot faster if you go into Updater preferences and toggle on "prioritize updater process", and make sure the screen stays on by using the Caffeine QS tile, or "never sleep while charging" toggle in Developer Options, or changing your Display timeout to 30 minutes.
- See XDA thread for other troubleshooting other common installation issues including problems with OxygenOS Camera & Gallery.
