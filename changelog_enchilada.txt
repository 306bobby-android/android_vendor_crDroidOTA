crDroid 9.12

Changelog since v9.11 (25 November) release:
- December 2023 Android Security Bulletin (android-13.0.0_r75) merged from AOSP.
- Upstream changes to ROM sources from LineageOS & crDroid merged.
  - I think we actually got Android-11-style QS Tiles as an option in crDroid, woo!
- Any device-specific device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes merged from LineageOS.
- Device-specific:
  - Redid things to be more unified between 13.0 & 14.0 branches.
  - Updated to most recent kernel commits from bananafunction's "lineage-20" branch.
  - Stopped trying to import half the scheduler tuning changes from crosshatch (since we're not migrating to libperfmgr in Android 13) and just let QTI perfd do its thing; it works fine.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Known issues:
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - We're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it. LineageOS devs agree that things are cursed on oneplus/sdm845.
  - The built-in Dialer app can't just pop on top with the fullscreen "incoming call" interface. Works fine when the screen is *off*, but if you want to actually see something over top of everything else when someone calls you and the phone is already awake, you need to enable Heads-Up Notifications. ROM devs are aware; seems to be an Android thing in general.
  - For some reason the "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option is greyed-out until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile; then it becomes available & works. ROM devs know, low-priority issue I guess.
  - The extra "Lock Screen" security options are missing due to an overlay in NikGapps which combines Security & Privacy settings fragments into a new layout, which clobbers our ROM layout. I'm working with Nikhail to figure it out, so in the mean time you can either use the current MindTheGapps arm64 13.0 release (if you feel like clean installing or resetting runtime permissions), or manually search Settings for "Quick Unlock" to find that screen.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - I dunno, our vibrator implementation kinda sucks (which is still thanks to OnePlus & Qualcomm). I tried to make it better; it didn't help much.
