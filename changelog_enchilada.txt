crDroid 9.4

Changelog since v9.3 (19 April) release:
- April 2023 ASB merged.
- Device trees/hardware/kernel/vendor changes pulled from LineageOS.
- crDroid:
  - Neobuddy managed to re-implement the "Unlinked ringtone & notification volumes" settings toggle & sliders properly, even better than my hack, in Settings > Sound & vibration, woo! Legend.
  - SystemUI should crash less often from Connection Manager "too many messages". _\*knocks on wood\*_
- Device-specific:
  - Updated kernel commits from bananafunction's stable lineage-20 branch.
  - Revert the "GL backpressure" commits from device tree; they were making the UI more janky.
  - The resurgence of "BlackScreenOS" on fajita in 9.3 should be squashed again. I might even try fixing it this way in Android 12.1 as well (for the two people still using that; don't say I never did anything for you :P ).
  - Fixed white slivers showing up at top screen corners on lockscreen on enchilada when using light theme.
  - Re-added Smart Pixels (it still looks ugly af, and I hate it, but it's at least smart enough to disable itself during UDFPS scan on fajita now, so might as well).
  - AFTER THREE YEARS I finally realized there were some overlayable configs for sensor-based doze customization timing. Adjusted timing so that ambient display pulses when you actually tilt/pick the thing up/take it out of your pocket, rather than 2.5 seconds later. Amazing.
- "Misc tweaks and bugfixes" (dropped a useless debug charging driver that wasn't doing anything except generate more logspam).
