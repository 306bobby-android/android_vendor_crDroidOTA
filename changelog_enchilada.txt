crDroid 7.39

FINAL ANDROID 11 RELEASE
Google is no longer releasing security patches for Android 11, LineageOS is no longer updating the lineage-18.1 branches, and so the crDroid dev team have End-Of-Life'd crDroid 7.x (11.0 branches).
There will be no further releases or updates to Android 11 for this ROM.
This marks the first full release cycle I've been a maintainer for, whew!

Changelog since v7.38 (21 January 2024) release:
- Merged February 2024 Android Security Bulletin from upstream AOSP & LineageOS.
- Whatever the ROM dev team changed upstream in LineageOS and crDroid sources (not much? they're busy with Android 14+).
- No changes to device-specific files.

Build type: Final
Device: OnePlus 6 (enchilada)
Device maintainer: Jordan Whiteley (Terminator_J)
Required firmware: OxygenOS 11.1.2.2
