crDroid 7.9 - 31 August 2021 release notes/known issues:

Common:
- Vendor blobs from OOS 10.3.12.
- August ASB merged (so no going back to earlier without formatting /data partition).
- Awesome Alert Slider! Have you ever wished the alert slider on your OnePlus phone had other, less-useful functions than controlling ringer & notification modes? Me neither! But now you can use it for other things anyway if you so choose, just like those crazy kids with their OnePlus 8 & 9 series phones! In the immortal words of Zoltan Kulle, "Not what I would do, but... when has that stopped you?"
- Still shipping with forked mcd kernel (arter97 base) r5, modded to build inline with our device tree particulars; updated to CAF msm-4.9 v4.9.280 and reenabled zram for swap (plus upped the background app limit in device tree; should stop killing background apps quite as instantly now). Will keep updated as upstream sources get updated. Why? Because video recording. LOS vanilla, crDroid stock branch (LOS fork with extras), and even newer mcd r6/7 (back to the Radioactive base) are wonderful, except when using them, video recording (or video conference apps like Zoom) crashes after about 10-12 minutes. During a global pandemic, it's probably for the best if your video chat keeps working, so there you go.

cr7-specific:
- Took a baby step towards getting hotword enrollment back working (and testing importing a tiny piece of the OOS 11 vendor blobs). It doesn't actually WORK from anywhere outside of the Google app/assistant, but at least you can enable detection again and train a voice model under Android 11. Unfortunately, getting it to work properly probably involves going way beyond what our upstream LineageOS maintainer is willing to spend time doing, and actually import stock audio mixer configs from OOS, which might require changing out the bluetooth stack while we're at it, and it's just a huge can of worms. But hey, for now, it's not any MORE broken. Baby steps!
- I spent a lot of time trying to fix things (like hotword enrollment -- still broken; getting built-in TWRP to compile & boot again -- it still freezes on bootloader unlocked warning screen; updating stock kernel to see if it would play nice with the cameras -- miraculously I got the DC dimming code cleaned up and the "stock" kernel is pretty tight, but video recording/conferencing still crashes the camera after about 10-12 minutes; etc.) that ultimately didn't work out. So this isn't gonna look like a huge update. But I put in a ton of time trying to work on that kind of stuff for you all (and for me; I use this thing too). Wish I had more to show for it.

Enchilada-specific:
- LineageOS upstream finally imported OOS antialiased software corner masks, so we can have smoothly rounded corners like fajita. Of course, if it was bothering you in the first place, can I recommend you stop wasting your battery/burning your eyes, and switch to dark mode?

Other known issues:
- WFD (WiFi Display, Miracast) is still currently broken, from upstream LOS.
- Per-app data accounting & per-network blocking is still broken, from upstream LOS.
- I guess screen-off gestures were a little screwed up and I didn't realize it. Re-worked the input/synaptics_driver_s3320.c touchpad driver to be less freakin' weird, and now *almost* everything works... except the "up vee" ( ^ ) gesture doesn't work (???). Like, wtf. It's like something else is eating that input scancode before it registers (much like the Button B problems with the goodix fp sensor and USB/BT gamepads on OP6 stock). I'm clueless, use a different gesture. Sorry.
- You tell me!
