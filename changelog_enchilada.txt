crDroid 9.13

Changelog since v9.12 (31 December 2023) release:
- January 2024 Android Security Bulletin (android-13.0.0_r75) merged from AOSP & LineageOS.
- Upstream changes from LineageOS & crDroid ROM sources:
  - Rebased on current lineage-20 branches for our devices.
  - They're probably mostly focused on Android 14 at this point, so don't expect a lot of feature changes now.
- Device-specific:
  - Updated to most recent kernel commits from bananafunction's lineage-20 branch.
  - More realigning to make it tidy with A14 sources.
  - Wasted a few weeks trying to see if it was going to be possible to drop debugfs in A13 the way it is in A14, and ... I don't know. But I'm not doing it for now.
  - Silenced OpenGL "could not match desired swap behavior" logspam.
- "Misc tweaks & bugfixes." :D

Known issues:
- Upstream crDroid/LineageOS/Qualcomm/Google issues:
  - We're using the source-built AOSP implementations for bluetooth & NFC, since it's not possible to continue with the old prebuilt QTI vendor blobs & implementation. Some things don't work as well; nothing I can do about it. LineageOS devs agree that things are cursed on oneplus/sdm845.
  - The built-in Dialer app can't just pop on top with the fullscreen "incoming call" interface. Works fine when the screen is *off*, but if you want to actually see something over top of everything else when someone calls you and the phone is already awake, you need to enable Heads-Up Notifications. ROM devs are aware; seems to be an Android thing in general.
  - For some reason the "QR Code Scanner" lockscreen shortcut option is greyed-out until you add the "QR Scanner" QS tile; then it becomes available & works. ROM devs know, low-priority issue I guess.
  - The extra "Lock Screen" security options are missing due to an overlay in NikGapps which combines Security & Privacy settings fragments into a new layout, which clobbers our ROM layout. I'm working with Nikhail to figure it out, so in the mean time you can either use the current MindTheGapps arm64 13.0 release (if you feel like clean installing or resetting runtime permissions), or manually search Settings for "Quick Unlock" to find that screen.
- crDroid OP6/6T-specific issues:
  - I dunno, our vibrator implementation kinda sucks (which is still thanks to OnePlus & Qualcomm). I tried to make it better; it didn't help much.
  - I have no idea why the battery drain after ~3 days keeps happening. I give up. Sometimes it seems fixed. Literally it seemed to be better in 9.12 hotfix 1 (never pushed to OTA), and back again in 9.13. There's NO CHANGE in device-specific things to account for it. Dropping debugfs and using /proc/wakelocks in kernel works, but... the system_server drain keeps happneing for some people. The "don't spoof fingerprint for Play Services Update" patch is still applied in ROM framework sources. I don't know what to say. It seems random who has the problem and who doesn't. If you have the problem, back up your stuff and try a factory reset. If it comes back, might as well upgrade to crDroid 10 (Android 14) which doesn't have the problem.
