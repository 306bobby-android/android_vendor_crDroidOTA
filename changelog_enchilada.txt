crDroid 6.21 - 31 August 2021 release notes/known issues:

Common:
- Vendor blobs from OOS 10.3.12.
- August ASB merged (so no going back to earlier without formatting /data partition).
- Awesome Alert Slider! Have you ever wished the alert slider on your OnePlus phone had other, less-useful functions than controlling ringer & notification modes? Me neither! But now you can use it for other things anyway if you so choose, just like those crazy kids with their OnePlus 8 & 9 series phones! In the immortal words of Zoltan Kulle, "Not what I would do, but... when has that stopped you?"
- Still shipping with forked mcd kernel (arter97 base) r5, modded to build inline with our device tree particulars; updated to CAF msm-4.9 v4.9.280 and reenabled zram for swap (plus upped the background app limit in device tree; should stop killing background apps quite as instantly now). Will keep updated as upstream sources get updated. Why? Because video recording. LOS vanilla, crDroid stock branch (LOS fork with extras), and even newer mcd r6/7 (back to the Radioactive base) are wonderful, except when using them, video recording (or video conference apps like Zoom) crashes after about 10-12 minutes. During a global pandemic, it's probably for the best if your video chat keeps working, so there you go.

cr6-specific:
- Aux camera doesn't work correctly due to framework issues beyond my control/comprehension. So, still no portrait mode in OnePlusCamera in cr6. 4Kp60 video recording works great; huzzah!
- Doesn't pass safetynet out of the box, despite many tests with different fingerprints/props. Just use Magisk & enable MagiskHide & possibly install MagiskHidePropsConfig module and be happy. If your bank's app doesn't work, switch to a local credit union and stop feeding the bougie bankers. Smash capitalism!
- Miraculously (miracastly?) WFD actually still just... works.

Enchilada-specific:
- LineageOS upstream finally imported OOS antialiased software corner masks, so we can have smoothly rounded corners like fajita. Of course, if it was bothering you in the first place, can I recommend you stop wasting your battery/burning your eyes, and switch to dark mode?

Other known issues:
- I guess screen-off gestures were a little screwed up and I didn't realize it. Re-worked the input/synaptics_driver_s3320.c touchpad driver to be less freakin' weird, and now *almost* everything works... except the "up vee" ( ^ ) gesture doesn't work (???). Like, wtf. It's like something else is eating that input scancode before it registers (much like the Button B problems with the goodix fp sensor and USB/BT gamepads on OP6 stock). I'm clueless, use a different gesture. Sorry.
