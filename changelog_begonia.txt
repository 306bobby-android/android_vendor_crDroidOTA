Highlights & Device Specific Changes:
Build type: Monthly
Device: Redmi Note 8 Pro (begonia)
A-11 device maintainer: TTTT555

Notes:
- If you have bootloop after installation, try format data again or to change GAPPS or flash MIUI and try again.
- Reboot after a clean install and initial setup so that the BegoniaParts item appears in the settings.
- GAPPS and Google Photo required for G-Cams. Opengapps recomended [ARM64 Pico or Nano (for OK Google)].
- If you will use Viper FX, then do not forget to enable legacy mode in the application settings.
- If you will use the built-in G-Cams, do not forget to apply configs (three taps between the camshot button and gallery button). If the camera does not find the built-in configs, just reboot the device and try again.
- If you OFF James DSP after ON, reenable Dirac (OFF/ON), if you need it.
- If you OFF G-cam 64 after ON, reboot the device, otherwise bugs are possible.
- ANX cam: If you have problems with a wide angle camera - just turn off the lens distortion correction function, or set the mode to 9/16.
